# regDemo

Purpose: To develop a web based registration application using spring-boot for webservices, angular for front-end, and deploy to AWS.
The application has a registration page, confirmation page, and a registered user report page.


What's to come: In the future, I would like to incorporate javadoc, tests, and more front-end and back-end functionality. I would also like to fix the deployment to AWS.The application runs on localhost and has complications running on AWS due using the h2 database and not a database like mysql.
